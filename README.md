# Simple Arithmetic Compiler

This project is an exploration of the basics of creating a compiler. By following the tutorial available on [Medium](https://medium.com/@trish07/building-a-simple-arithmetic-compiler-in-c-4f703fa9e6c1), I learned how to build a simple compiler for arithmetic expressions in C. The compiler currently supports only addition and subtraction operations, without parentheses or other operators.

## Objectives

- Understand the fundamental concepts of compilers
- Learn to parse and interpret arithmetic expressions
- Implement a simple compiler in C

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-arithmetic-compiler.git
    ```
2. Compile the project:
    ```bash
    cd simple-arithmetic-compiler
    gcc main.c
    ```
    ```

## Usage

Run the compiler with an arithmetic expression as input:
```bash
./a.exe
```

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to the author of the tutorial for this excellent introduction to compiler construction.
